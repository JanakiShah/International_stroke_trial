Stroke is a significant global health concern, accounting for a substancial burden of morbidity and mortality. Ischemic strokes(IS) occur when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstruvted, while hemorrhagic strokes (HS) involve the rupture of a blood vessel,
leading to bleeding within the brain. Understanding the survival outcomes for both types is paramount, as it informs medical decisions, interventions, and care plans. This study delves into the comparative analysis of survival rates post-treatment, utilizing the IST
dataset, aiming to unravel crucial insights that can guide healthcare professionals in navigating the complexities of stroke management and improving prognosis for patients with diverse stroke types.


## Study Design
We will use The International Stroke Trial (IST) dataset, it was a large, randomized, open trial of up to 14 days of antithrombotic therapy started as soon as possible after stroke onset.

## Study Population
In our study, we focused on patients who had death at 14 days and 6 months after randomization to aspirin and heparin treatments either due to hemorrhagic stroke or due to ischemic stroke. 

## Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize patient characteristics of the total sample characteristics. Next, a comparison of the two-stroke types was done based on the Kaplan-Meier survival curves by comparing survival rates at 14 days and 6 months.
The Cox regression model was used to perform multivariate analysis of influencing factors with both mortality outcome and survival time as dependent variables. Cox proportional hazards regression used to determine independent predictors of mortality among participants
were expressed as estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  All the statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software SAS.
